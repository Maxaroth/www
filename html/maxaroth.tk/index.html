            The fate of MWP
        </h2>
        <p>
            This has been a really fun week and a half in terms of learning. However this project is just a learning experience and unfourtionately this site will no longer be my primary focus. Maxaroth.tk will continue to be updated and hosted on this address, however it will be only for testing stuff and maybe memes if i feel like it. the new site will be https://transtopic.ga and will be a blog and podcast for trans and lgbt content. I hope to see you all there! ❤❤❤
